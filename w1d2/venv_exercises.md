# 🧪 Virtual Environment Exercises

## Exercise 1: Basic venv Creation and Activation (Command Line)

### 🗂️ Create a Project Folder

1. Open your terminal (Git Bash on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Create a new directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir my_test_project
   cd my_test_project
🐍 Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv .venv
# Or use python3 if needed:
python3 -m venv .venv
This creates a .venv folder containing the Python interpreter and libraries.

⚡ Activate the Virtual Environment
Platform	Command
macOS/Linux (bash/zsh)	source .venv/bin/activate
Windows (Git Bash)	source .venv/Scripts/activate
Windows (Command Prompt)	.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Windows (PowerShell)	.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 (May require: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process)

Your terminal prompt should now include (.venv) or similar.

✅ Verify Activation
bash
Copy
Edit
which python   # macOS/Linux
where python   # Windows
Ensure it points to the .venv folder.

bash
Copy
Edit
which pip      # or `where pip`
🚪 Deactivate the Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
deactivate
Why this matters: This is the fundamental workflow you'll use constantly when working on servers or deploying apps.

Exercise 2: Package Management with pip Within a venv
🔁 Re-activate Your venv
bash
Copy
Edit
source .venv/bin/activate
# or the OS equivalent
📦 Install Packages
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install pandas
📋 List Installed Packages
bash
Copy
Edit
pip list
Should include requests, beautifulsoup4, pandas, and their dependencies.

📄 Generate requirements.txt
bash
Copy
Edit
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Open requirements.txt in a text editor to see exact versions.

🚪 Deactivate Again
bash
Copy
Edit
deactivate
Why this matters: requirements.txt defines and shares your project's dependencies for consistent setup.

Exercise 3: Replicating an Environment from requirements.txt
🧹 Simulate a New Setup
Delete .venv:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf .venv  # macOS/Linux
Or delete it manually on Windows.

OR:

Create a new project:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir my_cloned_project
cd my_cloned_project
# Copy requirements.txt here from previous project
🐍 Create and Activate a New venv
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv .new_venv
source .new_venv/bin/activate  # or OS equivalent
📥 Install from requirements.txt
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ Verify
bash
Copy
Edit
pip list
Should match the original environment.

🚪 Deactivate
bash
Copy
Edit
deactivate
Why this matters: This is how deployments and collaborator setups work. Consistency is key.

Exercise 4: Understanding Your IDE's venv Management
🛠️ Create a New Project in Your IDE
Use PyCharm, VS Code, etc., and let the IDE auto-create a venv.

🔍 Locate the venv
Find the .venv path (inside the project folder or central location).

🔄 Activate Manually
Use terminal outside IDE:

bash
Copy
Edit
source <path_to_ide_venv>/bin/activate
🧪 Use IDE Terminal
Check if it auto-activates the venv:

bash
Copy
Edit
which python
🔧 Point IDE to a Manual venv
Go to project settings and set Python interpreter to .venv or .new_venv created in earlier exercises.

Why this matters: Knowing how IDEs manage venvs demystifies the process and helps you debug or customize as needed.

🧠 A Note on "Mastery"
Don’t worry about memorizing every venv flag. Focus on:

Understanding the workflow

Knowing why each step matters

Repeating the process in real projects (like SkillForge)

Hands-on practice builds real skill—keep experimenting and reach out with questions anytime!
